## Research

My current research interests include;

### Implemetation of an FPGA-based Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) system.

Developing a faster and more efficient MCMC system, thus making MCMC algorithms more practical for real day-to-day problems. In order to achieve this my focus has been laid primarily to FPGAs for thier low energy consumption and the possibility to implement custom float algorithms. 

I have achieved so far to built a simple Hasting-Metropolis MCMC system to simulate a two-dimensional Lenz-Ising Model for my Bachelor's thesis.

### Spectral analysis using Bayesian statistics.
