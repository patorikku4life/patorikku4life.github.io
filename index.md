### Implemetation of an FPGA-based Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) system.

My current research interest include developing a faster and more efficient MCMC system, thus making MCMC algorithms more practical for real day problems. In order to achieve this my focus has been laid primarily to FPGAs for thier low energy consumption and the possibility to implement custom float algorithms. 

I have achieved so far to built a simple Hasting-metropolis MCMC system to simulate a two-dimensional Lenz-Ising Model for my Bachelor's thesis.
